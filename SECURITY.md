### 🕵️ Reporting Vulnerabilities

Spotted something suspicious?  
Whether it's a leaky token, an API misfire, or something Gandalf wouldn’t trust — **report it**.

**How to report:**

- Create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/tuliosousapro/Kindle-To-Notion-Extension/issues) and label it `security`.
- Include:
  - Extension version
  - Steps to reproduce
  - Potential impact

**What happens next?**

- You’ll get a response within 48 hours
- If it’s real, we’ll work on a fix and credit you (if you want)
- If it’s not, we’ll still appreciate the effort — no trolls here

### 🔐 Best Practices You Should Follow

Even magical extensions need human help:

- Never share your Notion API token publicly.
- Make sure your Notion integration only has access to the databases it needs.
- Remove unused permissions regularly.
- Don't install random forks of this extension unless you trust the wizard behind them.
