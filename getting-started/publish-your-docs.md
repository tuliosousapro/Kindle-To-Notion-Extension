# Installation

First of all, our GitHub repository has the latest versions of the extension, but it can always have some bugs. Even though you are using a tested version, you should always go with the production-ready version from your browser store.

If you want to go with our repo, here is a quick guide:

1. Clone or download this repository. <a href="https://github.com/tuliosousapro/Kindle-To-Notion-Extension" class="button primary" data-icon="github">GitHub Repo</a>
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
3. Enable "Developer mode" (top right).
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the folder containing the extension files.
5. VoilÃ  â€” The extension will appear in your Chrome toolbar.

> ðŸ’¡ Prefer a one-click install? [Get it from the Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kindle2notion-extension/camgnmkmolfidaefoidblkkloimnmalo?authuser=0\&hl=pt-BR)

Now, either way, you will follow the same steps to configure your extension. So there's a step-by-step guide to help you.
