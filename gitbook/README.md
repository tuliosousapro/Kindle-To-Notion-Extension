# Welcome

Have you ever used a Kindle to read your books? Have you ever tried to work on your notes? Maybe tried to organize for further reference?

Well, I have. And it happens to be the most boring task in the world. Copy and pasting just sucks. It's time-consuming and definitely gives you more work than organization.
