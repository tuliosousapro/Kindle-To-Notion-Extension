# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: October 15, 2025**

This Privacy Policy outlines how the Kindle2Notion Extension ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, protects, and shares your data. Our goal is to ensure transparency and safeguard your privacy while enabling the extension’s functionality.

***

### 1. Data We Collect

We collect only what’s necessary to export your Kindle highlights and notes to Notion:

* **Kindle Highlights and Notes**: Text, book titles, authors, and cover image URLs from `https://ler.amazon.com.br/notebook` and `https://read.amazon.com/notebook`. Used to transfer your data to Notion.
* **Notion Integration Data**: Your Notion API token and database ID, provided by you. Needed to connect and send data to your Notion account.
* **Technical Data**: Browser version, IP address, and error logs. Help us improve the extension and fix issues.

We don’t collect personal info (e.g., name or email) unless you share it for support.

***

### 2. How We Use Your Data

Your data is used solely to:

* Export Kindle highlights and notes to Notion.
* Enhance the extension’s performance and troubleshoot problems.
* Assist you if you reach out for support.

We do **not** use your data for ads or sell it to anyone.

***

### 3. Data Sharing

We share your data only when essential:

* **With Notion**: To complete the export process via their API.
* **For Legal Reasons**: If required by law or to prevent harm (e.g., fraud).

No other parties get your data—no analytics, no marketers.

***

### 4. Data Security

We protect your data with:

* **HTTPS**: Secure data transmission to Notion.
* **Local Storage**: Notion API token and database ID stored encrypted in Chrome’s local storage.
* **In-Memory Processing**: Kindle data is processed during export and not saved.

No system is 100% secure, but we take every reasonable step to keep your data safe.

***

### 5. Web Browsing Activity

We access your browsing **only** on:

* `https://ler.amazon.com.br/notebook`
* `https://read.amazon.com/notebook`

This is necessary to retrieve your highlights and notes. No other sites are monitored.

***

### 6. Your Rights

You control your data:

* **Manage**: Edit or delete your Notion token and database ID in the extension’s pop-up.
* **Delete**: Email us to remove any support-related data.
* **Stop**: Uninstall the extension to end all data collection.

See “Contact Us” below for details.

***

### 7. Data Retention

We keep data only as long as needed:

* **Kindle Data**: Deleted after export (no storage).
* **Technical Logs**: Kept for 30 days, then erased (anonymized unless tied to support).
* **Support Info**: Removed after resolution or upon request.

***

### 8. Limited Use Compliance

We follow Chrome Web Store’s Limited Use rules:

* Data is used only for the extension’s purpose.
* No ads, no credit checks, no unauthorized transfers.
* Human access is limited to support (with consent) or legal/security needs.

***

We may revise this policy as needed. Check back here (linked in the extension popup and Chrome Web Store) for the latest version.
